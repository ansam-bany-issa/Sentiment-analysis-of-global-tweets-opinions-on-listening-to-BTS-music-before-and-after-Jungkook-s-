#Hello friends
This is my first project in this site, so I hope you to like it, SO, 
before you start coding, you need to install two libraries (Tweepy and snscrape) then you can go ahead 
but if you do not want to collect the data and using my dataset! You have to extract them from the zip file 
and apply the pre-processing code on both of them, after the preprocessing make sentiment analysis
by using Roberta to compare the result between both of datasets.
